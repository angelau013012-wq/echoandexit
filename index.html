  <!-- Article content -->
  <p>No matter time or place, children can always find a way to entertain themselves. But in today’s world, it’s not swings, or storybooks — it’s screens. For many teens, social media is their new playground.</p>

  <img src="images/eng-hold.jpg" alt="Family using phones together" style="width:100%; max-width:800px; border-radius:12px; margin:30px auto; display:block;">

  <p>As technology advances, it is inevitable of the new generation exposed to never-changing digital trends. Since we can’t avoid it, the best approach is to teach young people how to navigate these platforms safely and responsibly.</p>

  <h2>1. Set Boundaries — Time Matters</h2>
  <p>Excessive screen time can affect more than just your mood — it can influence your brain, sleep patterns, and even physical health. Studies show that teens who spend more than three hours per day on social media are more likely to experience anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, and poor sleep quality. Research also links heavy social media use to difficulty concentrating and decreased academic performance, as the constant notifications and alerts fragment attention.</p>

  <p>Limiting your social media use gives your brain time to rest, reduces stress, and allows you to focus on offline activities like sports, reading, or creative hobbies. Experts suggest short, timed sessions — for example, 30–45 minutes per platform — instead of scrolling endlessly. Using app timers or built-in screen-time trackers can help you stick to these limits.</p>

  <p>There’s also evidence that reducing screen time before bed significantly improves sleep quality. Exposure to blue light from phones and tablets suppresses melatonin, making it harder to fall asleep and leaving teens fatigued the next day. A consistent “phone-free” period before bedtime can help reset your sleep cycle and improve overall well-being.</p>

  <p>Controlling your time online isn’t just about cutting back — it’s about taking control of yourself. The more time you spend scrolling, the easier it is to lose touch with reality and get pulled into a digital loop of comparison, trends, and validation. Setting boundaries helps you stay grounded in the real world and prevents social media from becoming your main source of self-worth or identity.</p>

  <p>In 2019, a tragic incident in Malaysia highlighted the dark side of social media’s influence. A 16-year-old girl posted an Instagram poll reading “Really Important, Help Me Choose D/L” (Death or Life). At the time, 69% of respondents picked “D” (Death), and hours later, she was found to have taken her own life. This heartbreaking case shows how vulnerable emotional states can be amplified online. Boundaries and real-world support matter tremendously.</p>

  style="width:100%; max-width:800px; border-radius:12px; margin:30px auto; display:block;">

  <h3>Additional Tip:</h3>
  <p>Pair limiting social media with a daily schedule. Plan offline activities like exercise, reading, or hanging out with friends. Structuring your day reduces screen time and encourages healthy habits that benefit mental and physical health.</p>

  <h2>2. Curate Your Feed — Follow What Inspires You</h2>
  <p>Unfollow accounts that make you feel anxious, inadequate, or stressed. Follow pages that inspire or educate positively. Social media algorithms show more of what you interact with — whether healthy or harmful. Frequent exposure to idealized images and “perfect” lifestyles online increases body dissatisfaction and low self-esteem among teens.</p>

  <p>Online trends can take dangerous turns. Challenges like extreme dieting, the “one chip challenge,” or older viral trends like the “Tide Pod challenge” spread quickly. Teens can be harmed by peer pressure or misinformation.</p>

  <img src="images/socials.jpg" alt="Social media feed filled with colorful posts" 
  style="width:100%; max-width:800px; border-radius:12px; margin:30px auto; display:block;">

  <p>Multiple teenagers — some as young as 10 — have died attempting viral challenges like the “Blackout Challenge.” Social media algorithms recommend similar content, trapping users in cycles of harmful influence.</p>

  <p>Curating your feed is more than unfollowing negative accounts — it’s actively reshaping your digital environment. The content you consume influences how you think, feel, and view the world. Following creators promoting education, kindness, and creativity expands your worldview.</p>

  <h2>3. Connect, Don’t Compare — The Real Side of Social Media</h2>
  <p>Social media was meant to connect us — to share, laugh, and feel less alone. But often, it becomes a mirror reflecting what we think we should be. Filters, photo editing, and unrealistic beauty trends distort that mirror.</p>

  <p>During adolescence, the body changes constantly. Online, “beauty” is often filtered, edited, and impossible to achieve. Trends like “clean girl” looks claim to be unedited but are often enhanced with lighting, angles, and Photoshop.</p>

  <img src="images/scrolling.jpeg" alt="Friends spending time offline" 
style="width:100%; max-width:800px; border-radius:12px; margin:30px auto; display:block;">

  <p>For teenage girls, this can damage identity and self-worth. Some restrict food, over-exercise, overeat, or spend heavily on skincare. For boys, constant exposure to posts about appearance, strength, money, or “status” creates pressure. Popularity and lifestyle comparisons are persistent online.</p>

  <p>Encouraging teens to follow inspiring accounts rather than pressure-inducing ones, and taking breaks from comparison-heavy feeds, helps maintain self-confidence and perspective.</p>

  <h2>4. Identity Influences — How Social Media Shapes Who You Become</h2>
  <p>Social media often distorts rather than reflects reality. Every scroll, like, and trend influences teens’ thinking, values, and self-definition. Beauty filters and lifestyle content can create unrealistic standards, pushing teens toward unhealthy comparisons.</p>

  <p>Algorithms track interactions and feed similar content. Awareness matters: asking “Why am I seeing this?” and “How does this make me feel?” builds digital self-awareness. Parents can guide teens toward critical thinking and resilience.</p>

  <p>Social media will always evolve, but our awareness can, too. Engaging mindfully ensures it reflects who we truly are, not who algorithms want us to be.</p>

  <hr>
  
  <p>At the end of the day, social media isn’t entirely the villain — it’s the way we use it that defines its impact. Growing up online can be empowering but exhausting. Quiet moments filled with scrolling, trends, and digital noise can replace real-world experiences.</p>

  <p>Learning to pause, think before posting, and take breaks isn’t giving up technology — it’s taking control. Setting limits, curating content, and being mindful protects mental space as exercise protects the body.</p>

  <p>It’s okay to unfollow people who drain confidence. It’s okay to step away when things feel heavy. It’s okay to prefer the real world — laughter, rain, stillness — over a screen that never stops asking for attention.</p>

  <p><strong>Because in the end, the goal isn’t to disconnect completely — it’s to stay connected, not consumed.</strong></p>
